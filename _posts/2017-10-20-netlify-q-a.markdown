As requested, these are my answers to the questions posed by Chris.

<ul>

<li>Rank your 5 favorite, and least favorite, activities from this list: https://gist.github.com/fool/b0f254ff8c72a5765b6a9138249789d6
What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?

What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  Be honest!  “it sucked” isn’t a wrong answer unless you don’t elaborate and provide some constructive criticism ;)
Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.
Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?

Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, that you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.
Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?
Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users

A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”.  Compose your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer without any additional data, that could be useful in the generic case but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.

(optional/bonus) Can you set up a redirect from “/netlify/anything” to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything ?</li>
</ul>
