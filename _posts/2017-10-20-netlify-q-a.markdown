<h4>What is your favorite thing about providing technical support?</h4>
As mentioned in my cover letter, I really live for the puzzle.  When a customer contacts support, they are usually at their wits end.  There is nothing like being able to work through their technical issue to get to the source of the problem and bring a smile back to a customer's face.

<h4>What did you think of our service during the time you used it?  Be honest!  “it sucked” isn’t a wrong answer unless you don’t elaborate and provide some constructive criticism ;)</h4>
The Netlify system is pretty slick, it's a straight forward system.  The push integration with GitHub is just awesome!

Really the only issue I had was a really minor usability one.  On the deployment pages, if you've scrolled down to look through the information, you have to scroll back to the top to find the "Back to Deploys" gray link on the black background.

<h4>Tell about how you made your site and why you chose the tools you did.  Briefly explain a challenge you experienced in setting up this site and how you solved it.</h4>

<h4>Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?</h4>

<h4>Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, that you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.</h4>

<h4>Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?</h4>

<h4>Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users</h4>

<h4>A customer writes in saying their “site won’t build”.  Compose your best short (2-paragraph) customer-facing answer without any additional data, that could be useful in the generic case but would also lead to a customer providing a more actionable response.</h4>

<h4>(optional/bonus) Can you set up a redirect from “/netlify/anything” to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything ?</h4>
